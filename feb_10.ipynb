    "# Automatic Resource Management: When using the with statement with open(), Python automatically takes care of opening the file and, more importantly, ensures that the file is properly closed when the code block inside the with statement is exited. This ensures that resources associated with the file, such as file handles and system buffers, are released promptly and efficiently, avoiding resource leaks.\n",

If an exception occurs within the code block, Python will still guarantee the file is closed properly before propagating the exception further up the call stack. This helps prevent data loss or corruption that might occur if the file was not closed correctly due to an exception.\n",

If the file already contains data, calling write() will overwrite the existing content from the current position. If the file is opened in append mode ('a'), the new data will be added at the end of the file.\n",
    "# writelines(): The writelines() method is used to write multiple strings to the file. It takes an iterable (e.g., a list of strings) as an argument and writes each element of the iterable to the file consecutively.
